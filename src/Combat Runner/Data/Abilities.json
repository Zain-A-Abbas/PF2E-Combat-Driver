		"AttackOfOpportunity": "<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature within the monster's reach uses a manipulate action or a move action, makes a ranged attack, or leaves a square during a move action it's using.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The monster attempts a melee Strike against the triggering creature. If the attack is a critical hit and the trigger was a manipulate action, the monster disrupts that action. This Strike doesn't count toward the monster's multiple attack penalty, and its multiple attack penalty doesn't apply to this Strike.</p>",
		"Aura": "<p>A monster's aura automatically affects everything within a specified emanation around that monster. The monster doesn't need to spend actions on the aura; rather, the aura's effects are applied at specific times, such as when a creature ends its turn in the aura or when creatures enter the aura.</p>\n<p>If an aura does nothing but deal damage, its entry lists only the radius, damage, and saving throw. Such auras deal this damage to a creature when the creature enters the aura and when a creature starts its turn in the aura. A creature can take damage from the aura only once per round.</p>\n<p>The GM might determine that a monster's aura doesn't affect its own allies. For example, a creature might be immune to a monster's frightful presence if they have been around each other for a long time.</p>",
		"Buck": "<hr />\n<p>Most monsters that serve as mounts can attempt to buck off unwanted or annoying riders, but most mounts will not use this reaction against a trusted creature unless the mounts are spooked or mistreated.</p>\n<p><strong>Trigger</strong> A creature @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.PM5jvValFkbFH3TV]{Mounts} or uses the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.q9nbyIF0PEBqMtYe]{Command an Animal} action while riding the monster.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Effect</strong> The triggering creature must succeed at a Reflex saving throw against the listed DC or fall off the creature and land @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{Prone}.

If the attack misses or the monster successfully defends against the falling rock, the monster catches the rock, takes no damage, and is now holding the rock.</p>",
		"ChangeShape": "<p>The monster changes its shape indefinitely. It can use this action again to return to its natural shape or adopt a new shape. Unless otherwise noted, a monster cannot use Change Shape to appear as a specific individual. Using Change Shape counts as creating a disguise for the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.actionspf2e.Item.AJstokjdG6iDjVjE]{Impersonate} use of Deception. The monster's transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine whether the creature is a member of the ancestry or creature type into which it transformed, and it gains a +4 status bonus to its Deception DC to prevent others from seeing through its disguise. Change Shape abilities specify what shapes the monster can adopt. The monster doesn't gain any special abilities of the new shape, only its physical form. For example, in each shape, it replaces its normal Speeds and Strikes, and might potentially change its senses or size. Any changes are listed in its stat block.</p>",

Coven members can sense other members' locations and conditions by spending a single action, which has the concentrate trait, and can sense what another coven member is sensing as a two-action activity, which has the concentrate trait as well.</p>\n<p>Covens also grant spells and rituals to their members, but these can be cast only in cooperation between three coven members who are all within 30 feet of one another. A coven member can contribute to a coven spell with a single action that has the concentrate trait. If two coven members have contributed these actions within the last round, a third member can cast a coven spell on her turn by spending the normal spellcasting actions. A coven can cast its coven spells an unlimited number of times but can cast only one coven spell each round. All covens grant the 8th-rank @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.dN8QBNuTiaBHCKUe]{Cursed Metamorphosis} spell and all the following spells, which the coven can cast at any rank up to 5th: @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.41TZEjhO6D1nWw2X]{Augury}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.vLA0q0WOK2YPuJs6]{Charm}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.HXhWYJviWalN5tQ2]{Clairaudience}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.zvKWclOZ7A53DObE]{Clairvoyance}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.yM3KTTSAIHhyuP14]{Dream Message}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.i35dpZFI7jZcRoBo]{Illusory Disguise}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Ucf8eynbZMfUucjE]{Illusory Scene}, @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.Ek5XI0aEdZhBgm21]{Scouting Eye}, and @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.FM3SmEW8N1FCRjqt]{Talking Corpse}. Individual creatures with the coven ability also grant additional spells to any coven they join.

		"Engulf": "<p>The monster Strides up to double its Speed and can move through the spaces of any creatures in its path. Any creature of the monster's size or smaller whose space the monster moves through can attempt a Reflex save with the listed DC to avoid being engulfed. A creature unable to act automatically critically fails this save. If a creature succeeds at its save, it can choose to be either pushed aside (out of the monster's path) or pushed in front of the monster to the end of the monster's movement. The monster can attempt to Engulf the same creature only once in a single use of Engulf. The monster can contain as many creatures as can fit in its space.</p>\n<p>A creature that fails its save is pulled into the monster's body.

		"TroopDefenses": "<p>Troops are composed of many individuals, and over the course of enough attacks and downed comrades, troops shrink in size. Most troops start with 16 squares (4 by 4), and their Hit Points have two listed thresholds, typically the first is at 2/3 their maximum Hit Points and the second is at 1/3 their maximum Hit Points. Once the troop drops below the first threshold, it loses 4 squares, leaving 12 squares remaining, and the first threshold becomes the troop's new maximum Hit Points. Once the troop falls below the second threshold, it loses another 4 squares, leaving 8 squares remaining, and the second threshold becomes the troop's new maximum Hit Points. In order to restore its size and maximum Hit Points, a troop needs to spend downtime to use long-term treatment on casualties or recruit new members to replace the fallen. At 0 Hit Points, the troop is reduced down to 4 squares, which is too few to sustain the troop, so it disperses entirely, with the few remaining members surrendering, fleeing, or easily dispatched, depending on their nature.</p>\n<p>A damaging single-target effect, such as a Strike, can't force a troop to pass through more than one threshold at once. For instance, if a troop had 60 Hit Points, with thresholds at 40 and 20, a Strike for 50 damage would leave the troop at 21 Hit Points, just above the second threshold. A damaging area effect or multi-target effect can cross multiple thresholds at once and could potentially destroy the entire troop in one shot.</p>\n<p>Non-damaging effects with an area or that target all creatures in a certain proximity affect a troop normally if they affect the entire area occupied by the troop. If an effect has a smaller area or numbers of targets, it typically has no effect on the troop. However, if the effect can target at least four creatures or cover at least four squares in the troop, and if it would prevent its targets from acting, cause them to flee, or otherwise make them unable to function as part of the troop for a round or more, the troop loses loses a number of Hit Points equal to the amount required to bring it to the next threshold, removing 4 squares. If an effect would both deal damage and automatically cross a threshold due to incapacitating some of the creatures in the troop, apply the damage first. If the damage wasn't enough to cross a threshold on its own, then reduce the Hit Points to cross the threshold for the incapacitating effect.</p>",
		"Wavesense": "<p>This sense allows a monster to feel vibrations caused by movement through a liquid. It's an imprecise sense with a limited range (listed in the ability). Wavesense functions only if monster and the subject are in the same body of liquid, and only if the subject is moving through the liquid.</p>"
